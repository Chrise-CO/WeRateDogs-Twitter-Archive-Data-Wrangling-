# WeRateDogs-Twitter-Archive-Data-Wrangling-
This is my second project in the Udacity/ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program which was focused on the data wrangling process. In this project, Wrangle and Analyze Data, I used Python and its libraries, to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, and then cleaned it.
